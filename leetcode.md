DnH Leetcode Group
---


This is a group to study Algorithms and Data structures. We will follow the EPI (Python) book chapter wise, serially. 

## Goal

Build the habit of leet code/competitive coding slowly. We will solve problems at our own pace, 3-4 problems a week. 

## Where?

On Slack, #codefights channel. Meet over Google Meet / Zoom - twice a week.

## How/What?

1. We will meet twice every week (mostly Tuesday and Friday at 9:30pm IST) on the evenings
2. Before the meeting, we will share the problems from the book
3. You will solve them on your own, at your comfortable pace
4. In the meet, we will discuss our approaches, share tricks, and also discuss code. We will also discuss other questions from the same chapter
5. go to 1

We will pick medium/hard problems. 

You may use other languages as well, but Python will be the primary language of this group.

## FAQ

1. I am preparing for FAANG in the next two months. Can I still join this study group? 

Yes, definitely. Solve the problems with the group, participate in discussions to solidify your learnings. However, do more problems in your own time. The channel will be active all the time, you can post questions and discuss. 

2. Three problems a week is slow. Can we solve more? 

You can certainly solve more in your time, use channel to discuss any questions from leet code or EPI. However the study group, we will do three problems a week. The idea is to build a habit, not solve more or be ready for interview in a month. If you are preparing for interviews, then you can always discuss in the channel.

## Old idea

We used to meet every two days, for 45 mins call where each of us would pick problems and solve them. The problem with this approach was, people who were too good, would solve problems quickly and sit idle. This would intimidate others as well. Some people would be slow, 45 mins weren't just enough.

## Logistics

On the page 8, the book provides few learning tracks:

We follow scenario 3, term project. Optionally, we will also do scenario 4. Following is our discussion schedule i.e. on these days we will discuss the questions mentioned 

| Date  | Mandatory Problems | Optional Problems |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Friday, 30th July  | 4.3, 4.11  | 4.9  | 
| Tuesday, 3rd Aug  | 5.5, 5.9  | 5.3, 5.10, 5.15  |
| Friday, 6th Aug  | 6.7, 6.8  | 6.9, 6.11  | 
| Tuesday, 9th Aug  | 7.10  | 7.11  |
| Friday, 13th Aug  | 8.3, 8.8  | 8.4  | 
| Tuesday, 16th Aug  | 9.11  | 9.13, 9.16  |

So, on 30th July we will have a call to discuss 4.3, 4.11 from chapter 4. We may also discuss optional problem 4.9 or any question from the same chapter.
